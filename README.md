# UNI-aspnetcore-workshops

This subject was about server side develpoment, using ASP.NET Core. The lectures were held online, but the workshops were offline, and we had to cooperate with random teammates. The Tasks were always one step harder, than the examples given in online lectures, So it was always challanging, but managable.
